# Zep Ball

A breakout-style game with a unique vertical paddle positioned on the right side of the screen. Inspired by z-ball (retro64).

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete! 🎮

The game is now in a **playable state** with core mechanics implemented:

- ✅ Paddle movement (keyboard + mouse)
- ✅ Ball physics with collision detection
- ✅ Paddle spin mechanics (paddle movement affects ball trajectory)
- ✅ Brick breaking system with particle effects
- ✅ Score tracking and lives system
- ✅ HUD display (score, lives, logo)
- ✅ Test level (5x8 brick grid)
- ✅ Level completion detection
- ✅ Game over on life loss

## Quick Start

### Requirements
- **Godot 4.6** (or later)
- Download from: https://godotengine.org/download

### Running the Game
1. Open Godot Engine
2. Click "Import" and select `zepball/project.godot`
3. Press **F5** to run the game

### Controls
- **W / Up Arrow**: Move paddle up
- **S / Down Arrow**: Move paddle down
- **Mouse**: Paddle follows mouse Y position
- **Space / Left Click**: Launch ball
- **Escape**: Pause/unpause game
- **R**: Restart game (no more F5 needed!)

### Debug Controls (Debug Build Only)
- **E/N/H**: Set difficulty to Easy/Normal/Hard (temporary - will move to main menu)
- **C**: Clear all bricks
- **1**: Spawn triple ball power-up

## How to Play

1. Move the paddle (right side of screen) to keep the ball in play
2. Launch the ball with Space or Left Click
3. Break all the bricks to complete the level
4. Don't let the ball pass the right edge or you'll lose a life
5. Game over when you run out of lives (starts with 3)

## Game Mechanics

### Unique Feature: Paddle Spin
- Moving the paddle while hitting the ball adds **vertical spin**
- Moving up while hitting: ball curves upward
- Moving down while hitting: ball curves downward
- Creates dynamic gameplay unlike traditional Breakout

### Combo System
- Consecutive brick hits build a combo multiplier
- 3+ combo: Bonus points activated (10% extra per hit)
- Combo resets when you lose a ball
- Visual feedback shows "COMBO x#!" on screen

### Brick Types
- **Normal (Teal)**: 1 hit to break, 10 points
- **Strong (Pink)**: 2 hits to break, 20 points
- **Unbreakable (Gray)**: Cannot be destroyed (not in test level)

### Difficulty Modes
- **Easy**: 0.8x ball speed, 0.8x score multiplier
- **Normal**: 1.0x ball speed, 1.0x score multiplier (default)
- **Hard**: 1.2x ball speed, 1.5x score multiplier
- **Note**: Difficulty selection will be available in the main menu (coming soon). Currently locked during gameplay.

## Development Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Mechanics (COMPLETE)
- [x] Project setup and structure
- [x] Paddle movement (keyboard + mouse)
- [x] Ball physics and collision
- [x] Brick system
- [x] Game state management
- [x] HUD and scoring
- [x] Test level

### ✅ Phase 2: Visual Polish (COMPLETE)
- [x] Random background images from asset pack
- [x] Screen shake on brick impacts
- [x] Ball trail effect
- [x] Paddle sprite graphics (Kenney assets)
- [x] Brick sprite graphics with variety
- [x] Particle effects on brick break
- [x] Power-up visual indicators
- [x] Improved pause system with UI indicator

### 🚧 Phase 3: Audio & Power-ups (Next)
- [ ] Sound effects (paddle hit, brick break, wall bounce, ball lost)
- [ ] Background music

- [ ] **[NEW] Expanded Power-ups**: More types including Warp, Repel, Guns, Big/Small Ball
- [ ] Multiple levels (5-10 unique layouts)
- [ ] Level selection menu
- [ ] Main menu
- [ ] Game over screen with retry option
- [ ] High score persistence

### 📦 Phase 5: Distribution
